# The new cross compiler has built-in specs which refer to the musl
# dynamic loader /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1... which will not exist on
# glibc hosts. We have to adjust this to build up the llvmtools with
# /llvmtools/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1, but keep the cross-gcc in
# cgnutools.
# This will be reached by creating a modified specs file in the
# proper location:
export MCGV=$(/cgnutools/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-musl-gcc --version | sed 1q | cut -d' ' -f3- )
/cgnutools/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-musl-gcc -dumpspecs | sed 's/\/lib\/ld-musl/\/llvmtools\/lib\/ld-musl/g' > /cgnutools/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-musl/$MCGV/specs

# Test the _tools toolchain:
printf "#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void){}\n" > dummy.c
/cgnutools/bin/x86_64-pc-linux-musl-gcc dummy.c
readelf -l a.out | grep ld

# Should output:
# [Requesting program interpreter: /llvmtools/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1]
# If matching, clean up:
rm -rf a.out dummy.c
